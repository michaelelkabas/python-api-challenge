There are two parts to this assignment
Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., 
and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.
The files are located in the starter_code folder. The API-KEY is ommited from GitHub for the API calls as was instructed in the assignment.
